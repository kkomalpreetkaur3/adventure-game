# Reflection on Space Explorer Adventure

## What I learned
- How to connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive browser game.
- How to use arrays and objects in JavaScript to store story data and branching choices.
- How to dynamically create buttons and update the DOM with 'document.createElement'.
- How to use Git commits to track progress step by step.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding how to link story branches using indexes ('next' values).
- Debugging when the buttons did not show up (fixed by checking innerHTML clearing).
- Styling buttons so they look clear against the dark background.

## Debugging Strategies
- Used console.log to check current question index during navigation.
- Used browser DevTools to inspect HTML elements created by JavaScript.
- Tested all possible paths to make sure each ending displayed correctly.

## Future Improvements
- Add images or background music for each scene.
- Include more branches and hidden endings.
- Track the player's path and display a summary at the end.
