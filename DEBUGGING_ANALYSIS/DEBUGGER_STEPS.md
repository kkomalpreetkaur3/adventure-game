# Debugging Analysis - Space Explorer Adventure

## Breakpoint 1 - After input processed
- Location: script.js — inside button.onclick after 'currentQuestionIndex = answer.next;'  
- Why chosen: Confirm the user's choice is processed and 'currentQuestionIndex' is updated before rendering next scene.  
- Before stepping (breakpoint1_before.png): show 'currentQuestionIndex = X', call stack shows onclick -> showQuestion.  
- After stepping (breakpoint1_after.png): show DOM updated to question with text "...".  
- Short analysis: The index updated correctly; 'showQuestion()' then renders the correct next scene.

## Breakpoint 2 — Story branching
- Location: script.js — top of 'showQuestion()'
- Why chosen: Inspect 'currentQuestion' object and ensure branching logic uses correct data.  
- Before stepping (breakpoint2_before.png): 'currentQuestionIndex = Y', 'currentQuestion.text = "..."'.
- After stepping (breakpoint2_after.png): New answer buttons are added to DOM.
- Short analysis:  Rendering logic cleared old choices and added new ones, as expected.

## Breakpoint 3 - Ending reached
- Location: script.js - where 'currentQuestion.answers.length === 0' is detected
- Why chosen: Confirm endings are handled and Next button behaviour is correct.
- Before stepping (breakpoint3_before.png): 'currentQuestion.answers' is '[]', 'currentQuestion.text = "..."'.
- After stepping (breakpoint3_after.png): Page displays ending; no answer buttons; Next visible for restart.
